# cashflow

first personal side project

# shop 
shop is the spring boot project repository.

# frontend 
frontend is created by create-react-app.
I will try to combine springboot using Java backend, thymeleaf as server side render template, and react as a front end interface. 
If I cant make it before I send resume, means I will only use Vanilla JavaScript.
